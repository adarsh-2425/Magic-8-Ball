# Magic-8-Ball
 The 8 ball represents the idea of chance because it can refer to both good and bad luck. It's also associated with having a sense of balance. Like the yin and yang, the 8 ball reminds people to take the good with the bad. The 8 ball is also a fortune-telling device that became popular in the 1940s.
